### I am Trevor Stephen Carter. 


##### Education
During the day, I am a full-time undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
studying Computer Science/Electrical Engineering and Literature.


##### Research

Through my academic and professional career, I have participated in a wide variety of research. The common
thread between them is my desire to connect multiple fields and disciplines together.


##### Creative Work

Permeating all of my creative pursuits is the desire to tell stories. Regardless of the medium,
I find no greater joy and satisfaction than sharing an experience, working over every detail
and facet of the story


##### Critique

There exists a derisive preconception that most critics of various media are snobby, pretentious
